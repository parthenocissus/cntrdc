lead: "A selection of early comics and cartoons, mostly hand drawn with black markers and wooden crayons on A4 and A3 paper."

Most of these comics and drawings were created during the bombing of Serbia and Montenegro. I was free from school so I could focus on drawing and making comics. After the war ended, the Youth Centre in Pančevo, Serbia, organized a small solo exhibition of these works.

The cartoon with the stereotypical Native American creating <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signal' target='_blank'>smoke signals</a> with a digital device won the Little Pier award, the award for the best children cartoon in Serbia and Montenegro. It many ways it marked my future complex relationship with digital technology. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
