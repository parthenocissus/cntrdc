lead: "In the age of the network, text is: (a) digital data; and (b) a commodity. The new AI-based textual regime calls for new literary practices."

“Optimised Poetry” is an example of such AI-dadaist (dataist?) practice. It is a collection of digital and algorithmic (anti)poetry, presented as a reading performance. Texts were written/generated using various digital techniques, including Markov Chains and Recurrent Neural Networks, the Google Ads Keyword Planner, Google Search Suggestions, as well as the Synesketch Textual Emotion Recognition Software.
