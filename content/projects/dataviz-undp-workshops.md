lead: "A compact introductory data visualization + communication workshop for the School of Data organized by the <a href='https://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home.html' target='_blank'>United Nations Development Programme</a> in Serbia. Carefully tailored to participants from diverse backgrounds, the programme combines fostering analytical skills with creative and divergent thinking."

<a href='https://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2019/otvorene-prijave-za-jesenju-kolu-za-podatke.html' target='_blank'>The School of Data</a> is a UNDP-developed programme for participants from public administration, civil society organizations, startups, media companies, and academia. It provides the introduction to data-driven technologies, statistical and programming tools, legal frameworks, and visualization approaches.

As the final part of the School of Data, my dataviz workshop focused on understanding the truthful and effective communication of large and small data sets. From historical cartography to modern interactive Web experiences, from <a href='/work/projects/category/data-art'>data art</a> to data journalism, we analysed what constitutes quality data-driven design. Special attention was devoted to explaining data-driven propaganda, ways of manipulating public via faux dataviz.

Participants got the chance to develop their own data visualization projects using various tools, such as <a href='https://d3js.org/' target='_blank'>d3.js</a>, <a href='https://www.tableau.com/' target='_blank'>Tableau</a>, and <a href='https://rawgraphs.io/' target='_blank'>Raw Graphs</a>. At the end, we have created a <span class='italic-style'>data performance</span>, including a physical scatter-plot made of participant bodies. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
