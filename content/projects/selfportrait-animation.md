lead: "<span class='italic-style'>Self-portrait</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Autoportret</span>) is an animated short film about a painting of a face, whose parts — nose, eye, ear, mouth, tongue, hair — have a mind of their own, thus creating a portrait in motion and interaction."

<span class='italic-style'>Self-portrait</span> is a story about an artist, who, while creating a potrait, realises that the painted parts of the face have a life of their own. Those parts, those little characters, start walking, jumping, loving, and fighting around, composing and decomposing a big picture. It is a story about a dynamic, interactive identity.  

The animation technique is a combination of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation' target='_blank'>traditional hand-drawn animation</a> and a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation#2D_animation' target='_blank'>computer 2D animation</a>.

The film was screened at several festivals in Serbia, USA, Hungary, and Spain. It won the ASIFA Award for Best Animation at the Balkanima Festival in Belgrade in 2007. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
