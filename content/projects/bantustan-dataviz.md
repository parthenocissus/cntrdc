lead: "Series of Interactive Data Visualization that follows movements of the book <a href='/works/projects/bantustan-book' target='_blank'>Bantustan: atlas jednog putovanja (Bantustan: The Atlas of a Journey)</a> is a book of travel prose written by Lazar Pašćanović, Marko Đedović, and me."

“Bantustan” is also an example of ergodic literature, since it contains hand-drawn maps and infographics which represent an interface for non-linear reading. The book was published in 3 editions (by now) and was presented in more than 30 cities across the Yugoslav region.

Literary critics and writers such as Vasa Pavković and Elis Bektaš described it as a new form of a novel.
