How should we feel and think about phantoms such as climate change, global migrations, Big Data, and high-frequency trading? These complex processes, no matter how abstract and shapeless might seem to us, affect our lives on a daily basis. How should we bring them to a level of human mind and body?  

<a href='http://www.javnidug.gov.rs/eng/default.asp' target="_blank">Public debt of the Republic of Serbia</a> is one such phantom: imperceptible yet present. Is it possible to convert it to an affective form sensible by human metabolism? 

As a poetic exercise in physical data visualization, Debt as Diabetes depicts the last 10 years of Serbian debt. For each year, the the debt-to-GDP ratio is presented as the amount of sugar used for the black coffee, a traditional drink the entire Balkan life is woven around. 

The project introduces sensory metaphors into play: sugar and debt, coffee and ritual pleasure, sweet drugs and collective luxury, diabetes and financial colonization. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
