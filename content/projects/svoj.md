The film was animated in a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation' target='_blank'>traditional hand-drawn fashion</a>. It required several hundred drawings, made on an old-fashioned animation table, scanned and digitally colored and edited. <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1383706/' target='_blank'>Vladimir Uspenski</a> was responsible for the sound design. The film was produced by the Youth Centre Pančevo.

It was screened in Serbia and Russia. It won the Best Debutant Award at the Belgrade Documentary and Short Film Festival in Serbia in 2002. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
