lead: "A digital literature workshop and a reading performance of poetic texts created via various experimental <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature' target='_blank'>digital and electronic techniques</a>. The performance was the closing event of the <a href='https://elementarium.cpn.rs/u-centru/artneuroscience-susret-umetnosti-i-nauke/' target='_blank'>Art + Science Conference</a> organized by the <a href='https://www.cpn.edu.rs/en/' target='_blank'>Centre for the Promotion of Science</a> in Serbia."  

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature' target='_blank'>Digital literary texts</a> presented at the event at the Polet Art District in Belgrade were created during a workshop which was also part of the <a href='https://elementarium.cpn.rs/u-centru/artneuroscience-susret-umetnosti-i-nauke/' target='_blank'>Art + Science Conference</a>. Poetic texts included ones generated by <a href='/work/projects/category/ai'>AI systems</a>, poetry optimised via Google Keyword Planner, and tactical counter-surveillance writing pieces meant to fool emotion recognition engines.

Here is an example of an <span class='italic-style'>artificial poem</span> written by an AI system based on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain' target='_blank'>Markov Chains</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network' target='_blank'>Recurrent Neural Networks</a>, translated into English:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>swimming slowly through the interstellar space<br>
the big turtle is coming<br>
with mill hoarfrost<br>
to the sanctuary<br>
in white she clothes the same trees<br>
no silence<br>
but it is difficult</p>
</div>

We've also created and curated AI-generated aphorisms and slogans:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>across the river cross the reason</p>
<p>stop the money and flowers will rise</p>
<p>will you ever turn the living scenes of your misery into an act of your own hands?</p>
</div>

Another example of AI-driven poetics are <span class='italic-style'>tactical poems</span>, sentences or verses writen or chosen with an intention to fool the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition#Automatic' target='_blank'>automatic emotion recognition engines</a>. Built to recognize emotional content of text, this kind of AI systems are mostly used in the context of digital marketing. I've done <a href='/work/writing#research'>extensive research</a> on these algorithms during my studies of informatics and my work on <a href='/work/projects/synesketch'>Synesketch</a>. Now the idea was to intentionally confuse these programs – recognizing new poetic sensibilities in such subversive and tactical approaches. Voila: 

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>i am happy but<br>
(recognised positive)</p>
<p><a href='https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/oskar-davico/hana' target='_blank'>love is a beacon and saved sailors</a><br> 
(recognised negative)</p>
<p>it is meaningless to love<br> 
(recognised positive)</p>
<p>poetry is not dead<br>
(recognised negative)</p>
</div>  

When text is put into the <a href='https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243?hl=en' target='_blank'>Google Keyword Planner</a>, the app suggests additional words and phrases you can use to improve and optimize the marketing utility of text. Instead of advertisements, we put various poems and reinterpreted the suggestions as <span class='italic-style'>optimized poetry</span>. Here is the optimised version of the poem <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/antun-branko-imi/pjesnici' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>Poets</span></a>, originally written by Antun Branko Šimić:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>new year greeting cards in rhyme<br>
books for reading<br>
quotes about life<br>
book suggestions<br>
love verses for her<br>
love verses for him<br>
sad quotes<br>
love dedication birthday<br> 
beautiful sentences</p>
</div>

Apart from keyword suggestions, Google Keyword Planner also provides information about the cost of words. Here is the commodified version of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/miroslav-antic/plavi-cuperak' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>The Blond Locks</span></a>, a poem by Miroslav Antić:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>

Before the workshop and the performance, I've explored these ideas in my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amLLN_dRdTc' target='_blank'>TEDx Talk</a> about the future of language at the Mokrin House, Serbia.

In the age of network any text is first and foremost: 1) data; and 2) a digital commodity. For global techno-linguistic capital, as <a href='https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200539?ln=en' target='_blank'>prof. Frederic Kaplan explains</a>, words are mere indexes of products and services. Why not use these techno-economic constraints as artistic and poetic constraints? New media regimes call for new poetic practices – <span class='italic-style'>dataism</span> instead of dadaism.

This type of work references diverse cultural practices, ranging from the work of <a href='https://monoskop.org/Zenit' target='_blank'>Zenitists</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo' target='_blank'>Oulipo</a> to projects of contemporary authors such as <a href='https://monoskop.org/Kenneth_Goldsmith' target='_blank'>Kenneth Goldsmith</a>, <a href='https://ahprojects.com/cvdazzle/' target='_blank'>Adam Harvey</a>, and <a href='https://pipthornton.com/2019/03/12/language-in-the-age-of-algorithmic-reproduction-a-thesis/' target='_blank'>Pip Thornton</a>. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
