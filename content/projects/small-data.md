lead: "Small Data is a live exercise in manual small data analysis, created in contrast to automatic big data analysis."

The workshop was structured through a series of questions, such as: If the people of old Nazca drew monkeys and whales, what are we drawing for ours gods (i.e. ourselves)? 

What are these modern geoglyphs telling us about our urban environments and dataspaces we inhabit? 

What are the tactics (in <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf" target="_blank">De Certeau’s terms</a>) we can employ as creative individuals living within huge technological systems? And what is the aesthetics of these tactics? <mark>&#9632;</mark>
