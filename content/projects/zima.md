lead: "<span class='italic-style'>Zima</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Winter</span>) is a booklet of experimental and avant-garde poetry. A collaborative project of Serbian and Balkan authors, its editors and writers include the <a href='http://www.skart.rs/' target='_blank'>Škart Collective</a>, <a href='https://www.davidalbahari.com/' target='_blank'>David Albahari</a>, Ljiljana Ilić, and more. My contribution consists of the poem <span class='italic-style'>Ljudi su poplave</span> (<span class='italic-style'>People are Floods</span>), the poem I generated with an <a href='/work/projects/category/ai'>AI system</a> I've written and taught to write."

<span class='italic-style'>Zima</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Winter</span>) is the first of the 4 poetry booklets published by the Albahari Cultural Centre. They were named after seasons: <span class='italic-style'>Zima</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Winter</span>), <span class='italic-style'>Proleće</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Spring</span>), <span class='italic-style'>Leto</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Summer</span>) and <span class='italic-style'>Jesen</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Autumn</span>). Diverse in style and technique, poems open up possible future directions for the poetic production of text.

<span class='italic-style'>Ljudi su poplave</span> (<span class='italic-style'>People are Floods</span>) is its only poem generated by a computer system. Here it is translated to English:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
they tear down unimportant things аbove the war island<br>
there is a trace of lips<br>
even if they laugh in your face<br>
you are approaching<br>
yet outside people are leaving<br>
people are floods</div>

The poem was generated using an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network' target='_blank'>RNN-based</a> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation' target='_blank'>text generation system</a>, trained on a combined corpus of Serbian texts, including pop rock lyrics of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mom%C4%8Dilo_Bajagi%C4%87_Bajaga' target='_blank'>Momčilo Bajagić Bajaga</a>, early modernist poems of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Crnjanski' target='_blank'>Miloš Crnjanski</a>, as well as the <a href='http://www.parlament.gov.rs/upload/documents/Constitution_%20of_Serbia_pdf.pdf' target='_blank'>Constitution of the Republic of Serbia</a>. After collecting hundreds of outputs, I've carefully selected the best ones, including <span class='italic-style'> People are Floods</span>.

Being an author of a generative piece means creating the training corpus, choosing the right machine learning parameters, and finally selecting the output. Computers are tools; in this case, the writer is a human who selects and edits. As I've written in the explanation of the piece, also published in the book: 

<span class='italic-style'>If the poem moves you, it is your fault; the computer program is not intelligent and it didn't want to say anything</span>.

Calling the poem a positive example of <span class='italic-style'>combinatorial plagiarism</span>, critics interpreted the poem as a love letter in the context of global migrations and local gentrification projects on the banks of Belgrade rivers. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
