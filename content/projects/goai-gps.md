lead: "Visual identity for the <a href='http://goodoldai.org/' target='_blank'>Good Old AI Lab</a>, a Belgrade-based laboratory for applied artificial intelligence, reimagined as a 64 km long <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing' target='_blank'>GPS drawing</a> I made by walking and cycling across Paris, France."

<a href='http://goodoldai.org/' target='_blank'>Good Old AI Lab</a> is an internationally recognized lab and network of award-winning researchers, engineers, and students working in the fields of applied artificial intelligence and software engineering, situated at the University of Belgrade. Prof. <a href='http://devedzic.fon.bg.ac.rs/' target='_blank'>Vladan Devedžić</a> is the principal of the lab.

For several years I worked at the Good Old AI Lab as a research and teaching assistant. I still collaborate with the lab as a research associate and a visiting lecturer.

This project came to be in 2009. as an experimental <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_media_art' target='_blank'>new media</a> reimagining of its visual identity, a plant-like spiral structure. I've made it by walking and cycling with a GPS device through Paris, France – the capital of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychogeography' target='_blank'>psychogeography</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situationist_International' target='_blank'>situationism</a>, the geo-drawing poligon of <a href='https://hundertwasser.com/en/texts/die_gerade_linie_fuehrt_zum_untergang' target='_blank'>F. Hundertwasser</a>. 

The entire design is 64 km long. It was my first experience with the practive of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing' target='_blank'>GPS art</a>. As such, it opened avenues for projects in the fields of <a href='/work/projects/category/geography'>experimental geography</a> and <a href='/work/projects/category/cartography'>cartography</a>.

It was when the project was already conceptualized that I've discovered <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Lines' target='_blank'>Nazca geoglyphs</a> in South America, large land art created by the ancient Nazca culture. One of the geoglyphs was a spiral-shaped monkey-like creature, eerily similar to Good Old AI logo. This synchronicity became an inspiration for the <a href='/work/projects/geoglyphs-zg'>geoglyph and GPS art workshop</a> I created for the <span class='italic-style'>Plan D</span> Design Festival and Conference in 2018.

The Good Old AI Lab GPS design was presented at the S.U.T.R.A. Festival of New Media and Digital Art in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2014. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
