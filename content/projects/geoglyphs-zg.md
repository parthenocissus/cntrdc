lead: "A three day workshop at <a href='https://2017.pland.hr/' target='_blank'>Plan D Festival, Zagreb</a> connecting the old practice of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Lines' target='_blank'>South-American Nazca lines</a> with the new media practice of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_drawing' target='_blank'>GPS drawing</a> — creating lines by walking or cycling with a GPS device."

The workshop was structured through a series of questions, such as: If the people of old Nazca drew monkeys and whales, what are we drawing for ours gods (i.e. ourselves)? 

What are these modern geoglyphs telling us about our urban environments and dataspaces we inhabit? 

What are the tactics (in <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/2/2a/De_Certeau_Michel_The_Practice_of_Everyday_Life.pdf" target="_blank">De Certeau’s terms</a>) we can employ as creative individuals living within huge technological systems? And what is the aesthetics of these tactics? <mark>&#9632;</mark>
