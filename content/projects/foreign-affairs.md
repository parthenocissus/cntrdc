lead: "Interactive data visualization that shows all travel expenses Serbian Minister of Foreign Affairs made during his tenure before 2013. It was a collaborative open data project between the Uzrok Design Studio and the <a href='https://birn.eu.com/' target='_blank'>BIRN</a> Investigative Journalism Team in Belgrade."

Uzrok Studio was an interaction and information design and film production studio founded and led by Srđan Keča, Bojan Franzee Brankov, Luka Knežević-Strika, Jovan Vesić, and me. 

One of our first projects was <span class='italic-style'>Foreign Affairs</span>, an interactive Web visualization of minister's travel expenses. The visualization was based on a data set provided by the <a href='https://birn.eu.com/' target='_blank'>BIRN</a> Investigative Journalism Team in Belgrade.

When published on BIRN's portal <span class='italic-style'>Javno</span> in 2013, the visualization created a significant viral effect. 

In 2019 I wrote an <a href='https://www.balkansmedia.org/en/node/129' target='_blank'>essay for Balkans Media about this project</a> (in Serbo-Croatian), taking it as a use case for showing <span class='italic-style'>dos</span> and <span class='italic-style'>don'ts</span> in contemporary data journalism. I focused on shortcomings of the project, in order to stress the importance of self-assessment.  

<span class='italic-style'>Foreign Affairs</span> was presented at the Republika Fest in Rijeka, Croatia, at the <a href='https://point.zastone.ba/program/the-cause-uzrok-for-vizualization-how-to-make-data-on-census-or-scientific-papers-interesting/' target='_blank'>Point Conference</a> in Sarajevo, BiH, as well as during an artist talk in Nova Iskra, Belgrade, Serbia. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
