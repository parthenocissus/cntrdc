      text: "<p>I am a Senior Associate at <a href='' target='_blank'>Petnica Science Center</a>’ Design Programme. Petnica is a talent campus for high school students from Serbia and the Balkans, located between a forest, a lake, and a cave near the city of Valjevo. Yearly design programme in Petnica consists of several one- and two-week seminars, where 15-30 selected students learn about basics of design and creative thinking by making their own projects. Topics range from graphic, industrial, and interactive design to visual art, creative coding, and animation.</p>
<p>Design Seminar was developed by <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/borut_vild' target='_blank'>Borut Vild</a>, <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/isidora_nikolic' target='_blank'> Isidora Nikolić</a>, and <a href='https://www.fsu.edu.rs/en/professor-vesna-pejovic/' target='_blank'>Vesna Pejović</a>. It is currently leb by Saša Mitrović and Igor Rajković, with a group of exceptional junior assistents, including Miloš Nikolić, Jelena Pejović, Tijana Radovanović, Nada Todorović, Una Korica, Sonja Jovanović, Miloš Desko Ćosović, Boban Živanović, Marija Pilčević, Teodora Ćirić, Ivan Avdić, and others. I am the part of the core team since 2016.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I was in a young astronomy student in Petnica. I find this experience valuable for our common goal of creating new constellations of creative knowledge between design, art, science, and technology.</p>"
