lead: "A digital literature workshop and a reading performance of poetic texts created via various experimental <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature' target='_blank'>digital and electronic techniques</a>. The performance was the closing event of the <a href='https://elementarium.cpn.rs/u-centru/artneuroscience-susret-umetnosti-i-nauke/' target='_blank'>Art + Neuroscience Conference</a> organized by the <a href='https://www.cpn.edu.rs/en/' target='_blank'>Centre for the Promotion of Science</a> in Serbia."  

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_literature' target='_blank'>Digital literary texts</a> presented at the event were created during a workshop which was also part of the <a href='https://elementarium.cpn.rs/u-centru/artneuroscience-susret-umetnosti-i-nauke/' target='_blank'>Art + Neuroscience Conference</a>. Poetic texts included ones generated by <a href='/work/projects/category/ai'>AI systems</a> based on Markov Chains and Recurrent Neural Networks, poetry optimised via Google Keyword Planner, and tactical counter-surveillance writing pieces meant to fool emotion recognition engines.

An example of a poem written by an AI system, translated into English:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>swimming slowly through the interstellar space<br>
the big turtle is coming<br>
with mill hoarfrost<br>
to the sanctuary<br>
in white she clothes the same trees<br>
no silence<br>
but it is difficult</p>
</div>

AI-generated aphorisms:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>across the river cross the reason</p>
<p>stop the money and flowers will rise</p>
<p>will you ever turn the living scenes of your misery into an act of your hands?</p>
</div>

Sentences written or chosen tactically in order to fool <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_recognition#Automatic' target='_blank'>automatic emotion recognition engines</a>:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>i am happy but<br>
(recognised positive)</p>
<p><a href='https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/oskar-davico/hana' target='_blank'>love is a beacon and saved sailors</a><br> 
(recognised negative)</p>
<p>it is meaningless to love<br> 
(recognised positive)</p>
<p>poetry is not dead<br>
(recognised negative)</p>
</div>  

Here is another example. When text is put into the <a href='https://ads.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/' target='_blank'>Google Keyword Planner</a>, the app suggests additional words and phrases you can use to improve and optimize the marketing utility of text. Instead of advertisements, we put various poems and reinterpreted the suggestions as <span class='italic-style'>optimized poetry</span>. Here are the results for a poem by Antun Branko Šimić, <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/projectgoethe/Home/antun-branko-imi/pjesnici' target='_blank'><span class='italic-style'>Poets are eternal wonder in the world</span></a>:

<div class='quoted-text tiny-quote-style'>
<p>new year greeting cards in rhyme<br>
books for reading<br>
quotes about life<br>
book suggestions<br>
love verses for her<br>
love verses for him<br>
sad quotes<br>
love dedication birthday<br> 
beautiful sentences</p>
</div>

Before the workshop, I've explored these ideas in my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amLLN_dRdTc' target='_blank'>TEDx Talk</a> about the future of language at the Mokrin House, Serbia. In the age of network any text is first and foremost: 1) data; and 2) a digital commodity. For global techno-linguistic capital, as <a href='https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200539?ln=en' target='_blank'>prof. Frederic Kaplan explains</a>, words are mere indexes of products and services. Why not use these techno-economic constraints as artistic and poetic constraints? New media regimes call for new poetic practices – <span class='italic-style'>dataism</span> instead of dadaism.

This type of work references diverse cultural practices, ranging from the work of <a href='https://monoskop.org/Zenit' target='_blank'>Zenitists</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo' target='_blank'>Oulipo</a> to projects of contemporary authors such as <a href='https://monoskop.org/Kenneth_Goldsmith' target='_blank'>Kenneth Goldsmith</a>, <a href='https://ahprojects.com/cvdazzle/' target='_blank'>Adam Harvey</a>, and <a href='https://pipthornton.com/2019/03/12/language-in-the-age-of-algorithmic-reproduction-a-thesis/' target='_blank'>Pip Thornton</a>. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
