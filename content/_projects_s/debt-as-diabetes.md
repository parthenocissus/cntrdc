lead: "<span class='first-word-project-title'>Debt as Diabetes</span> is an installation that maps Serbian debt to an amount of sugar for black coffee, drawing a parallel between diabetic illness of a single organism and financial dependency of a collective one."

How should we feel and think about phantoms such as climate change, global migrations, Big Data, and highfrequency trading? These complex processes, no matter how abstract and shapeless might seem to us, affect our lives on a daily basis. How should we bring them to a level of human mind and body?  

<a href='http://www.javnidug.gov.rs/eng/default.asp' target="_blank">Public debt of the Republic of Serbia</a> is one such phantom: imperceptible yet present. Is it possible to convert it to an affective form sensible by human metabolism? 

As a poetic exercise in physical data visualization, Debt as Diabetes depicts the last 10 years of Serbian debt. For each year, the the debt-to-GDP ratio is presented as the amount of sugar used for the black coffee, a traditional drink the entire Balkan life is woven around. 

The project introduces sensory metaphors into play: sugar and debt, coffee and ritual pleasure, sweet drugs and collective luxury, diabetes and financial colonization. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
