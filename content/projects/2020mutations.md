lead: "A series of drawings I made with black marker when I was in high school. In total, there are 2102 different cartoon profiles on 18 A4 papers."

It started as a non-thinking activity, something I was doing in parallel with studying geography or history, and eventually grew into a project on its own, visual exploration of different cartoon faces. The number 2102 doesn't mean anything, I just had to stop somewhere and I liked that number.

Youth Centre Panƒçevo organized a small exhibition of these drawings in 2002. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
