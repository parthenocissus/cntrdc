lead: "The 60-Month Walk is a collaborative experimental work of land & data art, created during a 3 day workshop for the <a href='http://vojnik.net/2017/' target='_blank'>Designer – Author or Universal Soldier Conference</a>. The work explores possibilities of physical data visualization as experience design."

In particular, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map' target='_blank'>heatmap</a> of local air pollution data was recreated as a 1 meter wide, 30 meters long walking path. The path is divided into 60 segments. Each segment represents a monthly air quality index. Grass stands for a month of good quality air, sand is medium, gravel is bad, rocks are terrible. 

By walking barefoot, a participant can feel the change of air quality during the period of 5 years. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
