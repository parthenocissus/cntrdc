lead: "<span class='italic-style'>Citizens on Watch</span> (<span class='italic-style'>Građani na straži</span>) is an infographic video, a data-driven animated short film I've created for the election monitoring initiative of <a href='https://crta.rs/en/gradani-na-strazi' target='_blank'>Center for Research, Transparency and Accountability</a> (Crta) in Serbia."

Before creating the video, a thorough data analysis was performed in order to understand better the past accomplishments of Crta initiatives. Based on this information, the narrative was built, later transformed into a storyboard.

Video was animated digitally, using 2D animation software. Its visual identity was based on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art' target='_blank'>8-bit pixel æsthetics</a>, a characteristic of old video games. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
