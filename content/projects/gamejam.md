lead: "Game design workshop for creating a simple 2D computer game out of drawings, photos, and a little bit of code. Participants are encouraged to focus on ideas, visuals, story and mechanics instead of technology."

The premise of the workshop is that not every video game should be a technically demanding 3D endeavor, and that the best digital works arise from a creative process that takes place in the physical world.

Also, could a computer game be intimate as a love letter? Could it be emotional or philosophical as a poem? Could it be socially and politically relevant? Could it be in some way cathartic, similar to a good novel or a film?  

In the first part of the workshop, we reflect on the history of first video games, 8-bit æsthetics and the concept of <span class='italic-style'>sprites</span>, animated elements that make the building blocks of 2D video games. Super Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog work in such a way. This mean any kind of animation can be used for game design: from photos and stop-trick techniques, to wooden crayons and animations drawn by hand. Each participant chooses their own animation technique and sprite method.

In the second part of the workshop, we connect these sprites with code, using the <a href='https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/' target='_blank'>P5 Play technology</a>. The coding part involves only the very basics of JavaScript. The focus is the interactivity, story, visuals, and creative mechanics. The final work is an open game platform in the form of a simple website, which integrates drawings, sprites, animations and software elements from all participants. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
