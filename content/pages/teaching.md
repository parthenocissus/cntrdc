      text: "<p>I am a Senior Associate at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petnica_Science_Center' target='_blank'>Petnica Science Center</a> Design Programme. Petnica is a talent campus for high school students from Serbia and the Balkans, located between a forest, a lake, and a cave near the city of Valjevo. Yearly design programme in Petnica consists of several one- and two-week seminars, where 15-30 selected students learn about basics of design and other creative endeavours by making their own projects. Topics range from graphic, industrial, and interactive design to visual art, creative coding, video and animation.</p>
<p>Design Seminar was founded by <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/borut_vild' target='_blank'>Borut Vild</a> and developed by <a href='https://www.designed.rs/intervju/isidora_nikolic' target='_blank'> Isidora Nikolić</a> and <a href='https://www.fsu.edu.rs/en/professor-vesna-pejovic/' target='_blank'>Vesna Pejović</a>. It is currently led by Saša Mitrović and Igor Rajković, with a group of exceptional junior assistents, including Miloš Nikolić, Jelena Pejović, Tijana Radovanović, Nada Todorović, Una Korica, Sonja Jovanović, Miloš Desko Ćosović, Boban Živanović, Marija Pilčević, Teodora Ćirić, Ivan Avdić, and others. I have joined the core team in 2016.</p>
<p>A long time ago, I was in a young astronomy student in Petnica. I find this experience valuable for our common goal of creating new constellations of creative knowledge between design, art, science, and tech.</p>"

      text: "<p>I’ve been a teacher and mentor of several award-winning students, the most prominent being Kristina Tica, Jelena Pejović, and Miloš Desko Ćosović:</p>
<p>– <a href='https://ticakristina.com/' target='_blank'>Kristina Tica</a>’s master project <span class='italic-style'><a href='https://ticakristina.com/Digital-Prayer' target='_blank'>Digital Prayer</a></span> was the winner of the <a href='http://www.seecult.org/konkurs/poziv-za-ucesce-u-projektu-evropska-laboratorija-vestacke-inteligencije' target='_blank'>National Competition for AI Art project</a>, organized by Belgrade Centre for the Promotion of Science within <a href='https://ars.electronica.art/ailab/en/' target='_blank'>European ARTificial Intelligence Lab</a>. <span class='italic-style'>Digital Prayer</span> was created by employing Generative Adversarial Neural Networks over a database of scanned icon paintings. Thus, a relation has been established between the canonical structure of an Orthodox icon and the image artificially created through computer program.</p>
<p>– <a href='https://www.instagram.com/sunflower0306/?hl=en' target='_blank'>Jelena Pejović</a> won several Best Student and Best Student Project awards at the Faculty of Media and Communications. Her undergraduate project <span class='italic-style'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BrgPt37gOTX/' target='_blank'>Generative Music Visualization</a></span> employs p5.js algorithms to responsive animated visuals in real-time.</p>
<p>– <a href='http://lakrc.com/' target='_blank'>Miloš Desko Ćosović</a> won the Faculty of Media and Communications’s Best Student Project award for his master project <span class='italic-style'><a href='https://www.amicentre.biz/residence-de-Milos-Cosovic-Desko.html?lang=fr' target='_blank'>Glitch Brush</a></span>, which uses glitch aesthetics in combination with real-time digital drawing. Project was publicly exhibited as a 3D mapping installation in Serbia and France.</p>"
