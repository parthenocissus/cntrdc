      html: "<p>First sketch was created by accident, when I once looked at the code editor sideways<sup id='s1'>1</sup>. The digital grid has become unusual, programmer's curly braces have become miniature birds. The digital cloud has somehow become clearer.</p>
      <p>In addition to the æsthetics of images, I believe that we also need the <em>æsthetics of systems</em>, new ways of feeling and sensing systems, structures and feedback loops within which we live – from software systems to climate, financial, and microbiological ones. Developing a sensitivity towards systems begins with the skill of changing perspective. We can also call it the art of parallax.</p>
      <p>I created the illustration at the invitation of Maja Ćirić<sup id='s2'>2</sup>, independent curator and art critic, as an accompanying visual of the Competition for the traditional Autumn Exhibition<sup id='s3'>3</sup> of the Association of Fine Artists of Serbia (ULUS), which will be held at the end of the year in the <em>Cvijeta Zuzorić</em> Art Pavilion in Belgrade.</p> 
      <p>The illustration was drawn in the given colors of the exhibition. The image is being generated over and over again, in infinite variations, with the help of p5.js<sup id='s4'>4</sup> technology. The code is open and free. You are welcome to use it<sup id='s5'>5</sup>. (Probably the most useful part of the code are functions for generating random numbers in asymmetric normal distributions, which control the shape of curly flocks.)</p> 
      <p>I have a few ideas for the future of nanoseagulls, but we'll talk about that later. For now, let it stay here as a digital exercise in style<sup id='s6'>6</sup>, as a sketch or a drawing similar to the ones I assign to students and workshop participants as part of my educational practice. <mark>&#9632;</mark></p>"
