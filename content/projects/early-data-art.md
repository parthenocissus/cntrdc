lead: "My first drawings were maps, graphs, and charts. Here is a selection of the earliest such art I've drawn when I was 6 years old. It was a starting point for <a href='/work/projects/category/data-art'>data art</a>, <a href='/work/projects/category/dataviz'>dataviz</a>, <a href='/work/projects/category/cartography'>experimental cartography</a>, <a href='/work/projects/category/geography'>geography</a>, and <a href='/work/projects/category/interactive'>interactive art and design</a> projects I'm involved in today."

Drawing a map is a child's way of orienting oneself. This collection involves different maps – different levels of geographical identification. A map of the house and the yard in the city of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%C4%8Devo' target='_blank'>Pančevo</a> where I grew up. A map of the region of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Banat_District' target='_blank'>South Banat</a>. A map of Europe, the World, the Solar System.

There are also anatomy charts, maps of internal body parts of my first comic book characters. There characters were heroes and villains, aliens and anthropomorphic animals. Their anatomy was completely made up. Each organ had its own function.

I view this selection of drawings as an example of a personal approach to <a href='/work/projects/category/data-art'>data as a medium</a>. 

In my <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOW9IeYoEqo' target='_blank'>talks</a> and <a href='http://www.klubputnika.org/zbirka/blogovi/bantustan/3930-geografsko-ja' target='_blank'>essays</a>, I've connected these maps and charts to the <a href='https://hundertwasser.com/en/applied-art/apa382_mens_five_skins_1975' target='_blank'>Friedensreich Hundertwasser's <span class='italic-style'>Man's Five Skins</span></a> and the way this artist felt the layered structure of one's identity. <mark>&#9632;</mark>
